EEP71: GUI
===================

Dependencies & How to Install Them
-------------------
This readme section is written with primarily Linux in mind.


1. python-opencv
Run ``pip install opencv-python``. Works the same way for Windows users.
If pip ran without error then you have successfully installed this dependency.

2. PyQt5
Run ``pip install PyQt5`` to install the PyQt5 library. This still requires you to install Qt5.

For Arch users run ``sudo pacman -S qt5-base``.

For Ubuntu users see https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu.

For Windows users see https://www.qt.io/download-open-source#section-2.


How to Run the Project
-------------------
Assuming all dependencies were installed correctly all you have to do is run ``python mainwindow.py`` in your terminal emulator.
